		The animation was made for my animation class. We were free to use whichever medium we wanted to, <br>
		so I decided to make it fully digital. I did consider incorporating physical aspects, and even started <br>
		making clay figures. The clay figures are of the main characters. This was scratched and I just decided <br>
		to make it only digital.

		The animation went through a stage of rough drafting. I then lined each frame and decided to lightly <br>
		color it. I didn't wanna make it too complicated for myself, as it is my first animation. I went for a more <br>
		minimalistic look, and it matches the simple meaning the series has.		<br>
	</p>
	
	<p> 
		The series follows two young characters, who like each other. However, the focus is more about the memories <br>
		they made one summer. It is meant to represent the longing of a more simpler time. Looking back to the past <br>
		with endearment, wishing those times never ended. It is based on my own feelings towards the past.<br>

		The game follows the same premise. However, you start off playing as the girl. The guy is late, but she must <br>
		still go to their meeting spot. There are a few minigames on the way there. Such as taking out the trash, avoiding <br>
		crabs and collecting shells. Once you get to that meeting spot, you play as the guy. You must accompany him to  <br>
		the spot.
