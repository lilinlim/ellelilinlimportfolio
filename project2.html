	<p>
		I have never used the software prior to this project. I have always wanted to start more 3D modeling, <br>
		and found out about this software that made it more approachable. I made the work to familiarize myself <br>
		with 3D creating softwares. I also have a harder time with creativity. I tend to make works that are <br>
		concrete. I don’t do much abstract art. I used this as an opportunity to to get out of my comfort zone <br>
		and make something different.try something different. <br>
		<br> <br>
		When creating each object, I tried to incorporate different shapes. I used some concrete ones, such as <br>
		cherries and clouds, while some aren’t actually objects. I also made some more random, flexible objects <br>
		and wanted to mix and play around with different colors and materials.
