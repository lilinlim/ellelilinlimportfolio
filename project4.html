	<h1> The Seven Mysteries </h1>
	
	<p> Medium: Collage </p> <br>

		My zine tells the story of a young school girl. The pages follow her journey across school. While it is <br>
somewhat unclear, the story itself follows a rather common Japanese cartoon theme called “The Seven <br>
School Mytseries” This type of theme revolves around seven different paranormal stories that happen <br>
on the school grounds, usually involving haunted areas. It is also common that once someone sees all <br>
seven of these so-called mysteries, an eight secret one appears. <br><br>

Since it is not clear what these mysteries are in my zine, it is up to the reader to interpret it. The first <br>
page indicates a cheery blossom tree. In these types of stories, it is common to confess behind the <br>
school near a tree. There tends to be a rumor surrounding it, stating that the confession will work if it’s <br>
beside the so-called tree. Page two showcases stairs. While it is hard to visually explain what tends to go <br>
on in this place is that the number of stairs vary each time. The next place is a classroom. Oddly enough, <br>
in the corner of the class there is a floating chair and desk. The fourth page is a collage of the bathroom. <br>
Many different rumors happen surrounding school bathrooms. There can be a stall that is closed, but <br>
mysteriously enough someone is there. Or a few others that are about ghosts or encounters. The next <br>
place our girl visits is a music room. In this room, there is a piano, but no one is playing it. The music <br>
notes indicate that someone is indeed playing it. In page six, someone is waving back to the girl. It <br>
actually is an art statue. Statues are not supposed to move, unless they are alive or haunted. The before <br>
last page is the school roof. The sky looks magical, somewhat unreal. It is filled with clouds of different <br>
colors. We finally fully see the school girl. Her face isn’t there for aesthetical purposes, but it can be up <br>
to interpretation. Is she actually the eight mystery?<br>
