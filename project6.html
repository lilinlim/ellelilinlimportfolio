	<p> 
		This game is a very simple platformer. It follows our main character that starts off in a <br>
		room and must leave it. To be able to escape, they must go through multiple levels with different <br>
		obstacles. They are lost in an alternate reality with no true concept of what is real and what is <br>
		not. Many of the different obstacles include moving platforms that move on the x axis, the y axis <br>
		as well as the z axis. There are also rotators and a mini maze. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The game was made during my Game Design class. There is full documentation, including a Game Design Document, <br>
		goals, maps and more.

		The game is also my first Unreal Engine project. So getting the hang of everything was a bit tough at first. <br>
		Making an interesting layout was the hardest. I really needed to use my creativity and think of new interesting <br>
		ways of keeping the game going with different levels. <br>
