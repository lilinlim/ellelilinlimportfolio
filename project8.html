	<h1> How Racism Affects Cathy Park Hong’s Perception of her Identity as an Asian American </h1>
	
	<p> Medium: Word </p> <br>

	<p>
		The written piece “How Racism Affects Cathy Park Hong’s Perception of her Identity as an Asian American” <br> 
		was my final assignment for my last English class in college. It is a text that analyzes Cathy Park Hong’s <br> 
		essay “Minor Feelings”. The requirements were to make an analysis about any of the essays we read during the <br> 
		second part of the session. All the texts are non-fiction and are autobiographical. There are topics of bullying, <br> 
		domestic abuse, racism and more. I believe many of the essays are relatable, and many people would be drawn to the <Br>
		themes and the techniques many authors use to communicate their stories. However, I chose to write about that essay <br>
		because how of it is very personal to me. I relate to Park Hong’s experiences and it made me aware of how there are <br>
		actually words to describe certain feelings. <br> <br>
			
		Before writing the text, I decomposed it in a few elements. As the essay covers a lot, I didn’t want my analysis <br>
		to be overwhelming and all over the place. I wanted it to be clear and concise. I decided on the key messages I <br>
		wanted to convey.  The progress of writing the text was very straightforward. It was written on paper in class. I <br>
		did not make a rough draft before, but did make a small plan. <br> <br>
			
		Hopefully, my text will be able to shed some light on how Asian-Americans feel. I also desire that readers understand <br>
		second-generation Koreans more, and become interested in learning more. <br> <br>
