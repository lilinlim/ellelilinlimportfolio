			My first decision was to choose the software. I decided on Ren’py, because it is quite easy to use and free. <br>
			I hesitated between choosing Twine, but Ren’py allows for more media to be inserted. I did plan on drawing <br>
			and adding my own art. I decided to make the art more sketch-like, to convey a specific aesthetic. <br><br>

			I wanted to create a dating sim that is similar to a classic romance animation. However, I didn’t know who’s <br>
			point of view I wanted, so I made the options to do both. The story follows two comical characters that follow <br>
			specific tropes, and are meant to parody them. The guy is a very blunt, unemotional guy who isn’t very expressive. <br>
			He actually doesn’t care much for in general, and proceeds with his life while trying to minimize any effort. The girl <br>
			is rather flustered and shows many emotions on her face, while not necessarily wanting to. Many of her words contradict <br>
			her actual feelings. <br><br>

			I wanted to make a simple game with a cute story. I enjoy romance stories with similar dynamics, so it was nice to <br>
			try to create my own. I wanted people to feel the same way, to be entertained and finding it cute as well. <br>
