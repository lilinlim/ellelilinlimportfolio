	<h1> Into the Woods </h1>
	
	<p> Medium: Unity, Krita, Clip Paint Studio </p>
	
	<p> This project is a work in progress unity game. The characters are inspired by Red Riding Hood.
	</p>

	<p>
		The game follows our main character, who's reminscient of red riding hood. It is set in a woods-like <br>
		area. The story is that both characters would eventually meet and it would follow their adventures together.

		These are some of the earlier sketches. The player has a bread-like weapon. And there are playful-like elements.

		Originally, this game was gonna be a platformer. However, during the code, I encountered a lot of issues <br>
		and ended up putting the whole project aside. While keeping the same concept, I decided to switch to making <br>
		an rpg. I found a playlist that fit into my vision and followed it.

		The current features in the game are player movement, a health and attack system, objects, enemies <br>
		a camera and more. There are different enemies, such as some that patrol. There are also different room codes. <br>
		There is a signal system and context clues. There are ways for the player to know when to investigate something.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		In that current prototype, only the player sprites are made by me.
