	<h1> My Portfolio </h1>
	
	<p> Medium: HTML, CSS, Notepad++ </p>
	
	<p> 
		This project is my portfolio, which is the website you are currently viewing.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I have decided to make my portfolio with code instead of using a website builder. <br>
		It is mostly made using HTML along with some CSS. While using a website builder <br>
		provides more ease and has more facility to convey an aesthetic layout, I wanted <br>
		to make it myself. I already know basic HTML and CSS from a website class I took <br>
		in college. <br><br>

		Before beginning, I decided on a few key features. I wanted a menu on the top of <br>
		the pages, a gallery with clickable images and an about me section. The colors changed <br>
		a bit with time, but I do not want to put overwhelming colors, nor too many. It is important <br>
		that the overall design of my portfolio does not take away from the selected pieces. <br><br>

		The portfolio went through a few vast changes. The changes included layout as well as <br>
		color. But the overall minimalistic simple look stayed. <br><br>

		The intention was to communicate an easy to navigate layout with all my works in it. <br>
		It has a project page with all projects, all in gallery format. Each project has its own <br>
		page. There is also an about me page. <br>
	</p>
	
	<br>
	<div class="container">
		<div class="image">
			<img src='images/pf.png'>
		</div>
	</div>
	<br>
	
	<p> 
		This is the first prototype version. As noticed, the colors and navigation bar have changed.<br>
	</p>
	
	<br>
	<div class="container">
		<div class="image">
			<img src='images/pr2.png'>
		</div>
	</div>
	<br>
	
	<p>
		This is the final prototype. The navigation bar is now more suitable, and any unnecessary titles<br>
		were removed. The design seems more full and fluid, which is preferred. It is also the stage where <br>
		I added a drop down menu.
